step 1: import libraries
step 2: EDA
step 3: separate variables x and y
step 4: train,test,split
step 5: selection of model
step 6: train the model
step 7: predict model
step 8: evaluation
For regression:
  mean squared error
  mean absolute error
  r2_score
  root mean squared error
For classification:
  accuracy
  precision
  recall
  f1_score
  confusion matrix
